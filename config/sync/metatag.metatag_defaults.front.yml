  description: "I'm an open source developer, technology enthusiast.\r\n\r\nIâ€™m a back-end engineer based in Surat, Gujarat, India. I work at Axelerant as a back-end developer.\r\n\r\nI graduated in 2010 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree (B.E.) in Information technology from Saurashtra University, Rajkot. I started as a web designer in a company based in Surat. Working there, I realised, I'm more keen to development then designing and I started to look for development jobs and that's how I started working as a PHP developer, Then I learnt about various CMS like Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal etc..\r\n\r\nI have been developing in Drupal since last 8 years. I have worked on theme development and module development in drupal. While not working, I spend time with my family. I enjoy watching movies, swimming, video games and reading blogs."
